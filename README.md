### Hi there 👋 I'm William Fish

### 🚀 About Me

I'm a software engineer passionate about open-source and always eager to learn and work on new technologies. I believe in the power of community and love contributing to various open-source projects including UK government and neovim-related projects.

- 🔭 I’m currently working with HMRC on the [Online Trade Tariff](https://github.com/trade-tariff/)
- 🐋 I’m currently learning *[go](https://gobyexample.com/)!*
- 💬 Ask me about Linux, Neovim, or programming with Ruby, Elixir, Python  or Go
- 📫 How to reach me: <william.michael.fish@gmail.com>
- ⚡ Fun fact: Postgres gets its name from "POST-Ingres" as it was a successor to the Ingres database developed in the 1970s. Despite its age, Postgres has remained one of the most innovative and robust open-source databases around.
